# Smart Buy Compare

Smart Buy Compare is a student-focused price comparison and smart buying platform that helps users compare product prices across multiple online stores, plan purchases using upcoming deals, and choose options based on delivery speed or cost.

The platform is designed to be simple, transparent, and trustworthy.

# Project Objective

College students often:
- compare prices manually across multiple websites
- miss discounts or buy at the wrong time
- struggle to balance delivery speed and price

Smart Buy Compare solves this by:
- showing verified prices from multiple platforms in one place
- highlighting upcoming deals so users can plan purchases
- ranking products based on delivery preference (fast vs cheap)
- redirecting users to official seller websites for secure purchase

# How the System Works

2. Data is stored in a database with timestamps

3. Users search for a product on the website

4. The system compares prices and ranks results based on user preference

5. Users click a product and are redirected to the official seller website

    ⚠️ The platform does not sell products or control checkout prices.
